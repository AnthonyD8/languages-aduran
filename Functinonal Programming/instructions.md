Instructions
Record a chat about functional programming style, and it's connection with:

Immutable objects.
Lambda functions
How are templates a meta-functional style?
With help with ChatGPT (if you like) make an example of a functional style solution to a problem using immutable objects.

Create immutable objects like Chair and Room (no mutators, const fields), and shared_ptr for ref-counted pointers.

Use a lambda in the implementation somewhere.

Pick a topic that starts with the same letter as your first or last name.  Some simple example!

Turn in: the chat, your code in C++, and a screen shot of it executing.  You will translate your idea into JS/Py for the next assignment.
