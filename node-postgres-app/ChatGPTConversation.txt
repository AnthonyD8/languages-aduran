1. User's Question: "what all do I need to do my own variation of an online thing?"
   - Answer: I explained that the user needs to create a full-stack Node.js and PostgreSQL application, and the Tic-Tac-Toe game would be a good variation for this project.

2. User's Question: "would a tik tac toe game be adequate for the assignment description?"
   - Answer: Yes, it would fit the assignment. The user needed a project similar to their teacher's Hangman project, and Tic-Tac-Toe works well for this.

3. User's Question: "would the app.js go in my database folder?"
   - Answer: No, I clarified that `app.js` should be at the root of the project because it handles the server-side logic for Express and routes.

4. User's Question: "okay let's start with the first item, init.sql"
   - Answer: I walked the user through setting up the `init.sql` file to initialize the PostgreSQL database.

5. User's Question: "okay I got that in there, now what?"
   - Answer: I instructed the user on setting up Sequelize models for `Game` and `Move`, explaining how these interact with the database.

   - Answer: I guided the user to set up the routes in `app.js` for starting a new game and making moves.

7. User's Question: "okay let's save the testing for later, what is the next step?"
   - Answer: I helped set up Docker configuration for PostgreSQL and Node.js.

8. User's Question: "const express = require('express'); Is this the right setup for app.js?"
   - Answer: I confirmed the setup but pointed out that the logic for `script.js` needed to be separated from `app.js` since client-side and server-side code was mixed up.

9. User's Question: "okay, I got the X's showing up but no O's are showing. How do I fix this?"
   - Answer: I explained how to fix the player switching logic so the game alternates between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).

10. User's Question: "How do I pull changes from Git? I get an error with divergent branches."
    - Answer: I instructed the user on using `git config pull.rebase false` to resolve the issue.

12. User's Question: "I'm getting an error: require is not defined in script.js. What do I do?"
    - Answer: I explained that `require()` is Node.js syntax and cannot be used in front-end JavaScript. I provided the correct front-end script code.

13. User's Question: "My game still places only X's and no O's. What else could be wrong?"
    - Answer: I reviewed the logic and confirmed that the server-side was correctly switching players, but suggested checking if the client-side was also updating the player state.

14. User's Question: "I'm having issues with Docker Compose not showing the ready message after starting."
    - Answer: I helped the user add a message at the end of the Docker Compose startup process to confirm when the app is ready and accessible via the browser.

15. User's Question: "I fixed that issue with pulling from Git but now the game online doesn't work at all, even when pushing start new game."

16. User's Question: "How do I fix the require is not defined issue?"
    - Answer: I explained the issue with mixing Node.js syntax in client-side JS and provided a solution.

17. User's Question: "How can I resolve the Git pull issue regarding divergent branches?"
    - Answer: I provided solutions for Git configuration commands and corrected the user's typo in the command.
